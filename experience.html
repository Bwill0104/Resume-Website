           <p>February 2020 - Present</p>
           <h3> I started working at Mathnasium when I was a sophomore in highschool and now 
            I am a sophomore in college. In my three years of working here, I have demonstrated different Math
            techniques for topics ranging from elementary mat to more advanced math such as Calculus. I try my best to 
            configure each lesson the each student because everyone learns in different ways. I have managed to work around 10-12
            hours per week while keeping up with my school work aswell.

            <p>June 2023 - June 2023</p>
            <h3> The purpose of this camp was to expose a class of upcoming 6th graders to STEAM, while they are 
                still at a young age. During the camp the students did different activities that introduced them to 
                different aspects of science, technology, engineering, art, and math. I was in charge of leading the
                groupd of students through each activity and recording their behvior while they completed each task.

           <p>June 2022 - September 2022</p>
           <h3 style="padding-bottom: 20px;"> During the summer before and at the beggining of my freshman year at the University of Arkansas, I have
            the amazing opportunity to do reserach. During my senior year in highschool, I took a class that taught me the 
            basics of Qunatum Computing, and from the class came the research opportunity. The purpose of the research was to study
            the toppological superconductivity of Iron-Sellerium-Tellirum. During my reserach I was able to see different propoerties 
            of quatum mateirals, and at the end of my research I was able to present the conclusions of what I learned
